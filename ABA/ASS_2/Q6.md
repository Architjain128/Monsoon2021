
## DNA
+ For Z Form DNA
    + Mean values of angle is roughly in the range of 120-140
    + Almost all angles are above 100 but randomly some angles with low values can be seen
+ For A Form DNA 
    + Mean values of angle is roughly in the range of 80-100
    + Few abrupt peaks can be noted here too.
+ For B Form DNA
    + Mean values of angle is roughly in the range of 110-130
    + It has quite random distributions of angles than other forms of DNA

## RNA
+ Mean values of angle is roughly in the range of 70-100
+ Almost all angles are less than 90 but randomly angles with huge difference can be seen around 130-160
